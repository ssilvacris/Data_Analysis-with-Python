# Data Analysis with Python Certification - freecodecamp
This repository contains five projects that I completed in order to get the Data Analysis with Python certificate from freeCodeCamp platform. 

In the Data Analysis with Python Certification (300 hours) I used libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to process and visualize data. 

Hereunder, the project I accomplished: 

## [Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation CalculatorPassed](https://github.com/ssilvacris/Data_Analysis-with-Python/tree/main/Mean_Variance)

Creation of a function that uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, and standard deviation of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix.

## [Demographic Data AnalyzerPassed](https://github.com/ssilvacris/Data_Analysis-with-Python/tree/main/Demographic_Data_Analyser)

In this project I analyze demographic data using Pandas. This data was extracted from the 1994 Census database.

## [Medical Data Visualizer](https://github.com/ssilvacris/Data_Analysis-with-Python/tree/main/Medical_Data_Visualizer)

In this project, I visualized and made calculations from medical examination data using matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas.

## [Page View Time Series Visualizer](https://github.com/ssilvacris/Data_Analysis-with-Python/tree/main/Page_View_Time_Series)

In this project Ivisualized time series data using:
* line chart
*  bar chart
*  box plots. 

I used the libraries:
* Pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn 

The dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03. 

## [Sea Level PredictorPassed](https://github.com/ssilvacris/Data_Analysis-with-Python/tree/main/Sea_Level)

In this project, I analyzed a dataset of the global average sea level change since 1880.Also I used the data to predict the sea level change through year 2050.
